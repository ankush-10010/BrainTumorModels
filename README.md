## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements deep learning models for the detection and classification of brain tumors using MRI scan images. The model is trained on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle, enabling accurate identification of different types of brain tumors to assist medical professionals in diagnosis.

## 🗃️ Dataset

The project uses the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle, which includes:
- A comprehensive collection of brain MRI scans
- Multiple tumor categories for classification
- High-quality medical imaging data
- Verified and labeled images

Dataset Source: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)

### Dataset Statistics
- Total Images: ~3,000 MRI scans
- Categories: 
  - Glioma
  - Meningioma
  - Pituitary
  - No Tumor (Normal)

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrainTumorModels.git
cd BrainTumorModels
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash

## 📊 Model Architecture

### Model 3 Architecture
Our best performing model (Model 3) uses a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture:

```
Model 3 Architecture:
├── Input Layer (224x224x3)
├── Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
├── MaxPooling2D (2x2)
├── Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
├── MaxPooling2D (2x2)
├── Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
├── MaxPooling2D (2x2)
├── Conv2D (256 filters, 3x3, ReLU)
├── MaxPooling2D (2x2)
├── Flatten
├── Dense (512, ReLU)
├── Dropout (0.5)
├── Dense (256, ReLU)
├── Dropout (0.3)
└── Dense (4, Softmax) # Output layer for 4 classes
```

Key Features:
- Deep architecture with 4 convolutional layers
- Progressive filter increase (32→64→128→256)
- Dropout layers for regularization
- ReLU activation for better gradient flow
- Softmax output for multi-class classification
